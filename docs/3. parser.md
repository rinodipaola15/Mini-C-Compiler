# Parser Module

## Purpose
The parser takes the list of tokens generated by the lexer and converts it into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).  
The AST represents the hierarchical structure of the source code, making it easier to evaluate or compile.

## Usage
```c
ASTNode* root = parse(&tokens);
print_ast(root, 0);
```

## AST Node Types

- **AST_NUMBER**: numeric literal
- **AST_IDENTIFIER**: variable name
- **AST_BINARY_OP**: binary operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)
- **AST_PRINT**: print statement
- **AST_LET**: variable declaration

## Notes

- `parse()` expects tokens produced by the lexer.
- `print_ast()` prints the AST recursively with indentation for better visualization.
- `indent` in `print_ast()` represents the number of spaces per tree level.
- **Statement linking in the AST**:  
  Each statement (like `let` or `print`) is represented as an individual AST node.  
  When multiple statements appear sequentially in the source code, they are connected using the `right` pointer of each node, forming a **right-skewed list**.  
  - The `left` pointer is used for the internal structure of the statement (for example, the expression in a `let` or `print`).  
  - The `right` pointer points to the **next statement** in the program.  

## Example

Given the source code:
```c
let x = 5 + 3;
print(x);
```

The lexer generates tokens which the parser converts into the following AST:
```
AST_LET(x)
  AST_BINARY_OP(+)
    AST_NUMBER(5)
    AST_NUMBER(3)
AST_PRINT
  AST_IDENTIFIER(x)
```

- `AST_LET(x)` → variable declaration for x
- `AST_BINARY_OP(+)` → the addition operation 5 + 3
- `AST_PRINT` → prints
