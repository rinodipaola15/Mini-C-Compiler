# Mini C Compiler

## Overview

This project is a **minimal compiler** implemented in **C** for a small, toy programming language. The goal is **educational**: to understand the inner workings of a compiler from scratch. Even if you have experience with web development, scripting, or standard application programming, this project will guide you through the core concepts that transform **plain text code** into something a computer can execute.  

This repository is designed so that each part is **understandable and modular**, making it easy to extend with new features like conditionals, loops, and more complex operations.

## Tools and Language

The project is written entirely in **C**, chosen for its clarity and direct mapping to low-level programming concepts.  

No external libraries are required â€“ the entire compiler is implemented using **plain C**, including:  
- Data structures for tokens, AST nodes, and symbol tables  
- String parsing and manipulation  
- Recursive functions for parsing and interpreting code

You will only need a **C compiler** (e.g., GCC or Clang) to build and run the project.

## Compiler Phases

The compiler is divided into several key **phases**, each responsible for a specific task. Understanding these phases is essential to grasp how modern compilers work:

1. **Lexical Analysis (Lexer / Tokenizer)**  
   - Converts raw text code into **tokens**, the smallest meaningful elements in a program (numbers, operators, keywords, identifiers).  
   - Example: the code `let x = 5 + 3;` is transformed into tokens: `[LET] [IDENTIFIER:x] [EQUAL] [NUMBER:5] [PLUS] [NUMBER:3] [SEMICOLON]`.

2. **Parsing**  
   - Organizes tokens into a **structured representation** called an **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)**.  
   - The AST captures the **hierarchy and order of operations** in the program.  
   - Example: `5 + 3` becomes a tree node `PLUS` with children `5` and `3`.

3. **Semantic Analysis**  
   - Checks that the program makes sense: variables are declared before use, operations are valid, etc.  
   - Builds a **symbol table** to track variable names and their values.

4. **Code Generation / Interpretation**  
   - Converts the AST into something executable.  
   - In this project, we use an **interpreter** approach: the AST is traversed and executed directly, computing results and printing output.

5. **(Optional Extensions)**  
   - Future phases may include optimization, bytecode generation, or outputting assembly code.

## Why This Project?

This project is perfect for developers who want to:  
- Understand **what happens under the hood** when code is compiled or interpreted.  
- Learn **core concepts of programming languages** and their execution.  
- Gain experience in **low-level programming** while still producing working, visible results.  

Even if your background is in web development, Python, or app programming, completing this project will give you insights into **how your code is transformed into machine-readable instructions**.
